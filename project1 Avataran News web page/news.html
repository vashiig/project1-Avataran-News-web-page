  <p>South Korean seven-member boy band, which topped the US charts this year, is among the magazine’s list of ‘Next Generation Leaders’ as it continues its world tour

BY KOREA TIMES
K-pop boy band BTS, which made history this year by becoming the first South Korean group to top the American Billboard music charts and sell out a US stadium, has now made it onto the front cover of Time magazine.
A Time report titled “How BTS Is Taking Over the World” was posted on the magazine’s website on October 10, along with video footage of an interview with BTS members.</p>
<img src="bts-time.png" alt="bts time cover" width="300" height="300" class="responsive">
<p>The report called the seven-member group “the most popular boy band in the world”, saying it was breaking new ground by setting records in the US and all across Asia, “without catering to Western audiences”.

  <h2>BTS Performs at Korea-France Friendship Concert in Paris with South Korean President in Attendance</h2>
  <p>BTS performed for South Korean president Moon Jae-in and other dignitaries in Paris at a special concert held on Sunday night (Oct. 14) to represent friendly relations between France and South Korea during a state visit from the peninsular leader.

The event was themed around the “Resonance of Korean Musicians,” and also featured MoonGoGo, Black Spring and a variety of other artists. Around 400 people -- which included both French and Korean officials as well as fans -- reportedly attended the concert.</p>
<img src="Dpe1IprUYAAk408.jpg" alt="bts" width="500" height="300" class="ressponsive">
<p>Following their performance, BTS met with Moon and shared several pictures on social media. Through the band's official promotional Twitter account, and then retweeted by the member's own account, the septet shared their photos with Moon and his wife, Kim Jung-sook.

BTS recently spoke at the United Nations about the importance of self-actualization and speaking for oneself.

The Paris performance came amid BTS' Love Yourself world tour and precedes an upcoming show in the French capital at the Accorhotels Arena on Oct. 19, following two shows in Berlin on Oct. 16-17. Moon is visiting France for four days before heading to Italy, Belgium, and Copenhagen.
